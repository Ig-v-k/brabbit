            Yeah, It's been a ride...
            I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
            Now some of you might still be in that place
            If you're trying to get out, just follow me
            I'll get you there

            You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
            But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
            Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
            When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
            What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
            Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
            I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
            And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
            No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
            From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
            Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
            Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
            Whichever comes first, for better or worse
            He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
            His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
            To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

            I'm not afraid to take a stand
            Everybody come take my hand
            We'll walk this road together, through the storm
            Whatever weather, cold or warm
            Just let you know that, you're not alone
            Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

            Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
            I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
            You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
            For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
            And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
            I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
            Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehhhh"
            Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

            Relax, I ain't going back to that now
            All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
            Cause I ain't playin' around
            There's a game called circle and I don't know how
            I'm way too up to back down
            But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
            Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
            This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
            But it's time to exorcise these demons
            These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

            I'm not afraid to take a stand
            Everybody come take my hand
            We'll walk this road together, through the storm
            Whatever weather, cold or warm
            Just let you know that, you're not alone
            Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

            And I just can't keep living this way
            So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
            I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
            I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
            I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
            Time to put my life back together right now

            It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
            Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
            So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
            And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
            I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
            I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
            My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
            No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
            To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
            So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
            You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
            Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
            Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
            Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
            But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and

            I'm not afraid to take a stand
            Everybody come take my hand
            We'll walk this road together, through the storm
            Whatever weather, cold or warm
            Just let you know that, you're not alone
            Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

            We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much
            But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
            It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
            'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
            Don't play games, it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over
            'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
            'Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
            And love is evil, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
            Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
            It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
            Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
            Don't ask me why I have no love for these muhfuckin' hoes
            Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
            I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
            It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryna start over
            I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster's
            Something I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, so it's over
            It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't joking when I told ya
            You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a

            I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
            And I'm aimin' right at you
            Right at you
            Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
            And I'm aimin' right at you
            Right at you
            Right at you

            I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes
            My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
            There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
            Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
            Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
            You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change
            It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
            I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
            But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
            Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
            Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
            That I won't be makin' a mistake, 'cause I'm a

            I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
            And I'm aimin' right at you
            Right at you
            Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
            And I'm aimin' right at you
            Right at you
            Right at you

            So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
            But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
            I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
            I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
            Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
            You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
            I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
            'Til I snap your neck like a popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
            I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
            Tears stream down both of my cheeks, now I let you go and just give
            And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

            And I would've did anything for you
            To show you how much I adored you
            But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
            Just promise me you'll think of me
            Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, 'cause I'm a

            I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
            And I'm aimin' right at you
            Right at you
            Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
            And I'm so lost without you
            Without you
            Without you
