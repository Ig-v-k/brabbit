                Yeah, It's been a ride...
                I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
                Now some of you might still be in that place
                If you're trying to get out, just follow me
                I'll get you there

                You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
                But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
                Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
                When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
                What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
                Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
                I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
                And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
                No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
                From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
                Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
                Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
                Whichever comes first, for better or worse
                He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
                His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
                To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

                I'm not afraid to take a stand
                Everybody come take my hand
                We'll walk this road together, through the storm
                Whatever weather, cold or warm
                Just let you know that, you're not alone
                Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

                Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
                I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
                You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
                For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
                And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
                I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
                Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehhhh"
                Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

                Relax, I ain't going back to that now
                All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
                Cause I ain't playin' around
                There's a game called circle and I don't know how
                I'm way too up to back down
                But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
                Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
                This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
                But it's time to exorcise these demons
                These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

                I'm not afraid to take a stand
                Everybody come take my hand
                We'll walk this road together, through the storm
                Whatever weather, cold or warm
                Just let you know that, you're not alone
                Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

                And I just can't keep living this way
                So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
                I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
                I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
                I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
                Time to put my life back together right now

                It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
                Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
                So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
                And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
                I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
                I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
                My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
                No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
                To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
                So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
                You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
                Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
                Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
                Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
                But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and

                I'm not afraid to take a stand
                Everybody come take my hand
                We'll walk this road together, through the storm
                Whatever weather, cold or warm
                Just let you know that, you're not alone
                Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

                We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much
                But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
                It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
                'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
                Don't play games, it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over
                'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
                'Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
                And love is evil, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
                Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
                It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
                Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
                Don't ask me why I have no love for these muhfuckin' hoes
                Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
                I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
                It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryna start over
                I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster's
                Something I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, so it's over
                It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't joking when I told ya
                You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a

                I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
                And I'm aimin' right at you
                Right at you
                Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
                And I'm aimin' right at you
                Right at you
                Right at you

                I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes
                My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
                There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
                Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
                Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
                You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change
                It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
                I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
                But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
                Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
                Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
                That I won't be makin' a mistake, 'cause I'm a

                I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
                And I'm aimin' right at you
                Right at you
                Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
                And I'm aimin' right at you
                Right at you
                Right at you

                So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
                But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
                I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
                I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
                Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
                You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
                I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
                'Til I snap your neck like a popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
                I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
                Tears stream down both of my cheeks, now I let you go and just give
                And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

                And I would've did anything for you
                To show you how much I adored you
                But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
                Just promise me you'll think of me
                Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, 'cause I'm a

                I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
                And I'm aimin' right at you
                Right at you
                Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
                And I'm so lost without you
                Without you
                Without you

                You sound like a bitch, bitch
                Shut the fuck up
                When your fans become your haters
                You done?
                Fuck, your beard's weird
                Alright
                You yellin' at the mic, you weird beard
                We doin' this once
                Your beard's weird, why you yellin' at the mic?

                Rihanna just hit me on a text
                Last night I left hickeys on her neck
                Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
                Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next, damn
                I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
                Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
                Realized I forgot to call you back
                Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
                Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, dad isn't mad
                But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man bun?
                The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
                Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
                Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
                I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
                Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo"
                So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
                With your corny lines (Slim you're old)
                Ow, Kelly, ooh, but I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
                By 29 I had three albums that had blew
                Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
                Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
                But you're a fuckin' mole hill, now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
                Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
                Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
                Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead
                Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still
                Are you eating cereal, or oatmeal?
                What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
                'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
                Dictionary
                Yo Slim, your last four albums sucked
                Go back to Recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago
                What do you know? Oops, know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
                Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch?
                Yeah, I had enough money in '02
                To burn it in front of you, ho
                Younger me? No, you the whack me
                It's funny, but so true
                I'd rather be 80 year old me than 20 year old you
                'Til I'm hitting old age, still can fill a whole page with a 10 year old's rage
                Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy
                Go play, feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
                Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
                Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
                Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
                You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
                Next to Taylor Swift, and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
                Kelly, they'll be putting your name
                Next to Ja, next to Benzino, die, motherfucker
                Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailey in vain
                Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)
                My biggest flops are your greatest hits
                The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
                So before I slay this bitch, mwah, give Jade a kiss
                Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (the fuck?)
                Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
                In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
                Now I gotta cock back, aim, yeah, bitch, pop champagne to this
                It's your moment, this is it
                As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
                Had to give you a career to destroy it
                Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
                I'll give you a B for the effort, but if I was three
                Foot 11, you'd look up to me, and for the record
                You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
                Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
                Give your life to be as solidified
                This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
                So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?
                Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
                How the fuck can him and I battle?
                He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
                I'll give him my sandals
                'Cause he knows long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow
                Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
                Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me
                You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
                You're fuckin' salty 'cause young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
                Your red sweater, your black leather
                You dress better, I rap better
                That a death threat or a love letter?
                Little white toothpick
                Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
                Thanks for dissing me
                Now I had an excuse on the mic to write, "Not Alike"
                But really, I don't care who's in the right
                But you're losin' the fight you picked
                Who else want it, Kells?
                Attempt fails, Budden, L's
                Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
                Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
                But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
                But Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
                That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah
                I'm sick of you bein' whack
                And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune, so let's talk about it (let's talk about it)
                I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
                Need to get the cock up out it before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
                I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
                Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
                Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
                So just leave my dick in your mouth, and keep my daughter out it

                You fuckin', oh
                And I'm just playin', Diddy, you know I love you

                We're volatile, I can't call it, though
                It's like too large a peg, and too small a hole (yeah)
                But she cheats and I catch her like the common cold (sneeze)
                Last time, I broke her collar bone, she's intolerablе (yeah)
                All I know is that the sex is phеnomenal, though

                We're an unlikely pair (yeah)
                Like two different Nike Airs
                But I'm the same size she wears (Jordans)
                So I think we're soulmates though (yeah)
                People don't like us together, but like we care (not me, not me)
                Yeah, but God strike me dead (yeah)
                She knows that I would walk over hot coals
                For her with both of my feet bare (yeah)

                But soon as I ask to hit (ask to hit)
                It's like she grabs a switch (grabs a switch)
                And turns me over her knee (yeah)
                'Cause my ass is whipped, yeah
                And I got her back, but I'm spineless (yeah)
                So when she stabs me in mine (yeah)
                It's like I just can't feel the knife (what?)
                As she pokes, jabs it, and slices

                One minute, she'll build me up (up)
                The next, she'll push me 'round
                Probably why she calls me "dumbbell"
                She lifts me up (yeah), then puts me down (huh)
                But I am under her thumbnail
                I must be under her spell
                It's like lookin' right into a gun barrel
                But none of these hoes can fuck with my girl
                She got that

                We wake up, break up, make up like Maybelline
                Now she's all made up like make-believe
                Probably why she's so fake to me
                But what the fuck's it gonna take for me to make her see?
                Strip her naked and take her keys
                I been plannin' this thing for weeks
                But I can't tell if I'm awake or asleep

                But if this is actually happenin', sucker for pain
                I'm stuck in this radioactive pattern
                But her by her motherfuckin' hair's
                All I imagine, dragon
                She lunges, attacks, and scratches
                But I ain't gonna stand for that shit
                Like Kaep for the National Anthem

                As I stab, I'm, laughin'
                So much for witchcraft and magic
                Abracadabra that bitch
                No turnin' back, I'm blackin'
                As I say farewell to the love of my life, I cut and I slice
                I give her one last hug goodbye
                Wipe the blood off my butterfly knife

                Watch her fuckin' die right in front of my eyes
                But in hindsight
                Think I just wanted to see what her insides look like
                As I pop another five Vic's
                That's what this high's like
                Look down, there's mud on my Nikes
                Shovel at my side, blood on my mic
                Now wake up to Music To Be Murdered By like-

                Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, oh
                I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
                I smell something in the air that's making me (high)
                I said, I smell something in the air that's making me high

                Okay, here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, fa-so-la-ti-da-so
                Lyrical Roscoe, kick back the Tabasco
                You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
                Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
                Picasso with a pick-axe, a sick asshole
                Tic-tac-toe 'cross your six-pack with X-ACTO
                Knives, stranglin' wives with thick lasso
                Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
                You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
                This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
                You do not wanna try this at home, my lil' vato
                This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
                So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
                Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
                It's not what you expected, nor what you thought, so
                'Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

                It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
                That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
                Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
                Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
                I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
                That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
                Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
                Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

                Your dreams are gettin' fulfilled, ooh, I'm literally gettin' a chill
                Spittin' at will, me and Dre have just finished splittin' a pill
                You're submittin' to skill, sittin' still
                I'm admittin' I'm beginnin' to feel like I don't think anyone's real
                Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Lama
                And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
                Please don't upset me, mama, you're lookin' sexy, mama
                Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama
                Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
                Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
                How many people you know who can name every serial
                Killer who ever existed in a row?
                Put 'em in chronological order, beginnin' with Jack the Ripper
                Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper
                Location of the woods, where the body was dragged and then dumped
                The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
                And which model, which lake they found her in, how they attacked the victim
                Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
                Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife, and which nun
                Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun

                It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
                That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
                Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
                Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
                I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
                That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
                Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
                Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

                When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
                You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
                Behind the board sits Dre, legends are made this way
                Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?
                Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
                Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
                He can give her some, she can give them some
                Get behind a LinnDrum, make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
                The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
                Startin' from scratch and then endin' up at the ending of
                Capable of winnin' a Pulitzer, so unbelievable, it's a
                Titanium cranium that's full of surprises
                When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
                You stare into your stereos (high)
                Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
                I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking

                It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
                That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
                Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
                Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
                I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
                That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
                Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
                Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
            `;
