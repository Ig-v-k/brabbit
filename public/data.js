I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out Look at me now; I bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama? I'mma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet And I don't know if no one knows it So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch 'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun 'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show" I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing But put yourself in my position; just try to envision Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing Going through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be! I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you!

And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you? What happens when you become the main source of her pain? "Daddy, look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane "Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?" I don't know go play, Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself I'll give you one underdog and you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-by baby...

And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'. That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin. I get the point. Fine. Me and Mommy are going." But, baby, wait.

Shh, mama's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise mama's gon' be alright And if you ask me to Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'mma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)`},

Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall "Next time?

I say that shit's just clowning , dawg C'mon! How fucked up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to Come to think about it, his name was... it was you Damn!`},

Uh School flunkie, pill junkie But look at the accolades the skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky but funky But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women-hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then But if I can't batter the women, how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? Don't mistake him for (Satan) It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas And take a vacation to trip a broad And make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard, be a king?
