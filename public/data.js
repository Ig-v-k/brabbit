I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out Look at me now; I bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama? I'mma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet And I don't know if no one knows it So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch 'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun 'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show" I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing But put yourself in my position; just try to envision Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing Going through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be! I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you!

    {"track":"Mockingbird","date":"","text":`Yeah I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now But hey, what daddy always tell you? Straighten up little soldier Stiffen up that upper lip What you crying about? You got me. Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry 'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers No more crying, wipe them tears Daddy's here, no more nightmares We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls Two little beautiful girls Lookin' puzzled, in a daze I know it's confusing you Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have got so bad between us I don't see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be when we was teenagers But then of course everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise mama's gon' be alright (Ha) It's funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me 'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying 'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time every house that we lived in Either kept getting broken into and robbed Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurts so bad it broke your momma's heart And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre And flew you and momma out to see me But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it And you and Lainie were too young to understand it Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here Lainie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah It's got a ring to it don't it? Shh, mama's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise mama's gon' be alright And if you ask me to Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'mma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)`}
