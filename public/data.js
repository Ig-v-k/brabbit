I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryna start over I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster's Something I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, so it's over It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't joking when I told ya You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon And I'm aimin' right at you Right at you Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June And I'm aimin' right at you Right at you Right at you I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take? Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open That I won't be makin' a mistake, 'cause I'm a I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon And I'm aimin' right at you Right at you Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June And I'm aimin' right at you Right at you Right at you So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin' You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin' I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin' 'Til I snap your neck like a popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live Tears stream down both of my cheeks, now I let you go and just give And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this And I would've did anything for you To show you how much I adored you But it's over now, it's too late to save our love Just promise me you'll think of me Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, 'cause I'm a I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon And I'm aimin' right at you Right at you Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June And I'm so lost without you Without you Without you`},

I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out Look at me now; I bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama? I'mma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet And I don't know if no one knows it So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch 'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun 'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show" I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing But put yourself in my position; just try to envision Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing Going through public housing systems, victim of MÃ¼nchausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be! I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet`}
